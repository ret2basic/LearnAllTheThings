- [x] A system should be able to access only the information it needs to perform its functions
- [ ] Users are given limited administrative privileges in a secure system

### Question 2

**Answer:**

- [ ] Make sure users know what authority they hold
- [ ] Create interfaces that make it clear what software the user is interacting with and providing information to.
- [x] Prevent users from granting authority unless their request is approved by the security staff

**Answer:**

- [ ] Withhold all details from users because it will only confuse them
- [x] Show a level of detail that’s informative and useful to the user, and no more than that
- [ ] Show users a much technical detail as possible so they can make an informed decision

### Question 4

If you are warning users about a security problem that has been detected, which is the best message to show them?

**Answer:**

- [x] A message that alerts them to the error and makes the most obvious option the one that stops the user from proceeding. A small link is given to ignore the warning and proceed.
- [ ] A detailed technical description of the error so the user can make the most informed decision about what action to take.
- [ ] A subtle message at the top of the page that a user can see but that will not interrupt their workflow.

### Question 5

**Answer:**

- [ ] Authority should be granted without requiring the user to explicitly give consent.
- [x] Users should be able to reduce the authority granted to others.
- [x] The interface should help users be aware of what authority they have granted in the past.
- [x] The easiest way to do a task should require the most minimal granting of authority.

### Question 6

True or False: A design guideline for creating usable secure systems is to make the most secure way to complete a task the easiest way to complete the task.

**Answer:**

- [x] True
- [ ] False

### Question 7

For an average user, which of the following is the most usable way to set file permissions?

**Answer:**

### Question 8

Which guideline is violated when an interface does not make capitalization differences unambiguous (e.g. a lower case "L" and capital "i" appear to be the same thing)

- [x] Make it easy to see the differences between objects and actions that could be confused.
- [ ] Make it easy for users to control access to their resources.

**Answer:**

- [x] True
- [ ] False

### Question 10

**Answer:**

- [ ] The more usable a system is, the less secure it is because users do not understand security, so to make a usable system, security must be downgraded or left off.
- [x] The more usable a system is, the more secure it is because usable systems help users make good security decisions and easily choose the most secure actions.
