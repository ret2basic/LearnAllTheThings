# Week 3

## Notes

### Qualitative Evaluation

- **Cognitive walkthrough**
	- Requirements:
		- Description or prototype of interface
		- Task description
		- List of actions to complete task
		- User background
	- What you look for:
		- Will users know to perfrom the action?
		- Will users see the control?
		- Will users know the control does what they want?
		- Will users understand the feedback?
- **Heuristic Analysis**
	- Follow "rules of thumb" or suggestions about good design
	- Can be done by experts/designers, fast and easy
	- May miss problems users would catch
- **Nielsen's heuristics**
	- Simple and natural dialog
	- Speak the users' language
	- Minimize user memory load
	- Consistency
	- Feedback
	- Clearly marked exits
	- Shortcuts
	- Prevent errors
	- Good error messages
	- Provide help and documentation
- **Conclusion**
	- Qualitative evaluation can provide insights into the usability of a system without measurements or timing
	- Various levels of complexity
	- Can be quick and inexpensive, but may miss insights users provide


### Running Controlled Experiments

- **Controlled experiment**
	- State a lucid, testable hypothesis
	- Identify independent and dependent variables
	- Design the experimental protocol
	- Run some pilot participants
	- Fix the experimental protocol
	- Run the experiment
	- Perform statistical analysis

### A/B Testing

- **A/B Testing** means giving users version A and version B and see which version they like better.

## Quiz

### Question 1

What is the goal of A/B testing?

**Answer:**

- [ ] To create software and release it in version A, refine and release version B, and so on.
- [ ] To allow users to choose interface options from a menu.
- [x] To compare the performance two (or more) interface variations.
- [ ] To test users' answers to quiz questions.

### Question 2

What is a heuristic evaluation?

**Answer:**

- [x] Analyzing a system according to a set of guidelines for good usability.
- [ ] Having users test a system with low-tech paper prototypes.
- [ ] Presenting a description of a system of a group of representative users.
- [ ] Developing a description of an example user and thinking about how he or she might use the system.

### Question 3

What is the goal of a usability study?

**Answer:**

- [ ] To study the theoretical aspects of usability.
- [ ] To test the security of a system.
- [ ] To develop new measures of usability.
- [x] To measure and describe usability of a system for given tasks.

### Question 4

If we ran an experiment to test if password logins were faster than a voice recognition authentication system, what would be required to show passwords were faster?

**Answer:**

- [x] Statistical tests showed that the password group logged in significantly faster than the voice-recognition group.
- [ ] The users of the password group reported higher satisfaction on surveys than the voice recognition group
- [ ] The average login time for password users was lower than for voice recognition users
- [ ] Password users remembered their passwords more easily than voice recognition users remembered how to authenticate

### Question 5

Which of the following is not something you would do when running a controlled experiment to evaluate an interface?

**Answer:**

- [ ] Have some people try using the control interface while other people try using the experimental interface.
- [ ] Have each person in the experiment try both interfaces.
- [x] Select average users to test the control interface and expert users to test the experimental interface.
- [ ] Provide users with training and instructions on how to use the control and experimental interfaces

### Question 6

Qualitative evaluation is intended to:

**Answer:**

- [x] Understand user experiences and reactions to a design.
- [ ] Measure how well a user remembers the steps required to complete a task.
- [ ] Count the number of errors a user makes when using the system.
- [ ] Time how long it takes a user to complete a task.

### Question 7

Which of the following is NOT a standard observation method

**Answer:**

- [x] Assisted Use
- [ ] Constructive Interaction
- [ ] Silent Observer
- [ ] Think Aloud

### Question 8

Why do we conduct usability studies on systems that have already been designed?

**Answer:**

- [ ] Users often make ignorant mistakes. A usability study will show areas in which users need better training.
- [x] Despite their best efforts, designer and developers cannot know exactly how users will interact with their system. A usability study will find previously uncovered errors.
- [ ] A usability study will show how much users like a system and that can help companies set the price for their software

### Question 9

Which of the following are typical questions to ask on a pre-test questionnaire? 

**Answer:**

- [x] What is your highest level of education
- [ ] What was most challenging about using the interface
- [ ] How difficult was it to complete task 1
- [x] What is your age

### Question 10

When conducting a controlled experiment, which of the following is not part of the process

**Answer:**

- [ ] Identify dependent and independent variables
- [ ] Design and test the experimental protocol
- [ ] State a lucid hypothesis
- [x] Explain to participants what conclusions you hope to draw from the results
