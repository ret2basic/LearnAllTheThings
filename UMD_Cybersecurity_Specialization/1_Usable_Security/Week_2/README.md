# Week 2

## Notes

### Design Methodologies

- **Design process**
	- Where do ideas come from?
	- Many processes:
		- Iterative design
		- System centered design
		- User centered design
		- Participatory design
		- Designer centered design
- **Iterative design**
	- Requirements
	- Design
	- Development
	- Testing
	- Repeat
- **System centered design**
	- What can be built easily on this platform?
	- What can I create from the available tools?
	- What can I do as a programmer find interesting to work on?
- **User centered design**
	- Design is based upon a user's:
		- Abilities and real needs
		- Context
		- Work
		- Tasks
- **Participatory design**
	- Problems:
		- Intutions wrong
		- Interviews etc. not precise
		- Designer cannot know the user sufficiently well to answer all issues that come up during the desing
	- Solution:
		- Designers should have access to pool of representative users. That is, END users, not their managers or union reps!
- **Designer centered design**
	- "It isn't the customers' job to know what they want." -- Steve Jobs
- **Conclusion**
	- Users can give a lot of valuable insight for design
		- Tasks
		- Context
		- Needs
	- Support designers coming up with ideas
	- Iterate to build better systems

## Quiz

### Question 1

What is the cycle of the iterative design process?

**Answer:**

- [x] Requirements - Design - Development - Testing
- [ ] Design - Analysis - Coding - Testing
- [ ] Design - Analysis - Testing - Refinement
- [ ] Requirements - Development - Release 

### Question 2

What's the difference between system centered design and user centered design

**Answer:**

- [x] System centered design is focused on what is easy to build on a platform while user centered design is focused on user needs and context.
- [ ] System centered design focuses on developing systems while user-centered sign focuses on developing user tasks.
- [ ] System centered design is about analyzing systems but user centered design is about analyzing users.

### Question 3

Which of the following are NOT good ways to incorporate user-centered design in the design of security systems?

**Answer:**

- [ ] Designing security based on the user's environment and work context.
- [x] Designing security based on what experts believe is best.
- [ ] Designing security around user tasks

### Question 4

When designing error messages, which are important factors to keep in mind for usability?

**Answer:**

- [x] Make the most secure options part of the user's natural task.
- [ ] Force users to approve security exceptions.
- [x] Use language that users will understand.
- [ ] Use technical terms to fully explain the message to users.
- [x] Provide users with clear exits to get out of a security warning.

### Question 5

If you were designing security for the entrance to a secure facility, which of the following should you consider?

**Answer:**

- [x] How often users enter and exit
- [ ] What programming libraries are easy to use and freely available 
- [ ] Which algorithms are most efficient
- [x] What tasks the users are in the middle of when they need to access the area.

### Question 6

Which of the following are disadvantages of personas?

**Answer:**

- [x] Too many personas can be difficult to create and manage.
- [ ] They make potential users too "real" for designers.
- [x] A diverse audience may be difficult to represent with a normal-sized set of personas.
- [ ] They are expensive and time-consuming to create.
- [ ] All team members work with a consistent model of users.

### Question 7

Which of these are advantages of low-fidelity (e.g. paper) prototypes

**Answer:**

- [ ] They let designers see the impact of font size, color, and other visual elements.
- [x] They can be created quickly and cheaply.
- [ ] They can be used to calculate how long it will take users to accomplish certain tasks.
- [x] Any team member can create one, regardless of programming skills.

### Question 8

Which of the following are present in good interface design?

**Answer:**

- [x] Easy to recover from errors.
- [ ] Encryption of all data transmitted on a network.
- [x] Minimal training needed for a person to use the system.
- [ ] Relies on common interaction techniques for familiarity.

### Question 9

Which of the following is NOT an important part of the design process

**Answer:**

- [ ] Solicit user input
- [ ] Consider usability guidelines
- [ ] Prepare a prototype
- [x] Compute the efficiency of the underlying algorithms

### Question 10

In participatory design and co-design, which of the following is true

**Answer:**

- [ ] Users design the system on their own based on a list of constraints provided by designers.
- [ ] Managers convey input from users to designers.
- [ ] Designers brainstorm and create prototypes after asking potential users questions.
- [x] Average users have equal standing with designers.
