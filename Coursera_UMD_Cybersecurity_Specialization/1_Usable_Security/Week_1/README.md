# Week 1

## Notes

## Usability

- Measuring usability:
    - **Speed**
    - **Efficiency**
    - **Learnability**
    - **Memorability**
    - **User Preference**

### Task and Task Analysis

- **Tasks** are goals users set out to accomplish in a system. Examples:
    - Check your credit card statement
    - Read the headlines
    - Authenticate to use iPhone
- **Common errors** in task creation:
    - Leading or too descriptive
    - Specific questions
    - Directing users toward things you want to tell them, not what they want to know

### Chunking

**Chunking** means aggregating several pieces of information into coherent groups to make them easier to remember.

### Mental Models

- Mapping
- Visibility
- Feedback
