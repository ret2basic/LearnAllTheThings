# NJU Static Program Analysis

The materials can be found on the [course website](https://pascal-group.bitbucket.io/teaching.html).

## Lectures

The lectures cover the "theory" part of this course. Topics include:

- Intermediate Representation
- Data Flow Analysis
- Interprocedural Analysis
- Pointer Analysis
- Static Analysis for Security
- Datalog-Based Program Analysis
- Soundness and Soundiness
- CFL-Reachability and IFDS

## Assignments

The assignments cover the "practice" part of this course. an educational static program analysis framework called "bamboo" was designed for this course and students are required to implement functions on top of it. The targets are **Java** programs. The five assignments are:

1. Constant Propagation Analysis
2. Dead Code Detection Analysis
3. Class Hierarchy Analysis
4. Pointer Analysis
5. Context-Sensitive Pointer Analysis

Unfortunately, only NJU students have access to the assignment materials at this moment. I will update my solutions here if the instructors open source these assignments in the future.
